I've never noticed how tv shows can reveal parts of ourselves or show us things we really want. I'm a full supporter of the famous "Netflix Binge". It's in these moments that I learn a little about careers. I used to make fun of my wife for all the medical shows she would watch. She would watch one and try to figure out what the doctors diagnosis was before they would say it within the episode. I'm sure a lot of us do this when it's a show we're intersted in.

We are naturally drawn to what we're interested in. You see, my wife works in the medical field. Even before she did, our binges would consist of some sort of medical drama series. As much as I teased her about it, I never noticed I did the same thing. "Silicon Valley" has been the show that she now makes fun of me for. It's basically a coders comedy. 

Learning to code isn't always easy. The frustration can be brutal in more ways than one but sometimes we need to see there is another side to what we want. A side that could lead to a rewarding life. However unreal a show may be, there is still something special in seeing yourself within a story. Whenever I watch Silicon Valley, I see the possiblities of becoming a solid programmer.

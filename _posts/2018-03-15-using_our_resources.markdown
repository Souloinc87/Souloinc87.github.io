What has made this experience at Flat Iron so great, is the network of people that support and help you understand the curriculum. When you see and hear that learning to code is hard, it is. Especially when you are learning to communicate through syntax. It's a similar experience to learning a new language. What I have found especially helpful is knowing that I'm not alone in my temporary road blocks to getting a solid knowledge in code.

So far, I've learned the basics of Ruby, Git, Github, and now HTML. I would dedicate this blog to explain what each of those are and how they work but I'm not there yet. I promised in my last blog that I would be as honest as I can in my writing. So, honestly I'm still putting the pieces together and I'm enjoying it. Its definitely a challenge worth taking on with the right frame of mind. 

What helps me get through each challenging section is asking for help. Getting stuck is half the battle but getting unstuck is the victory. I would recommend reaching out as much as possible. Everyone in the Flat Iron community has been where we are in one way or the other. Whenever you are on a screenshare, ask as much as you can. I've learned cleaner and shorter ways to polish up my code that aren't always covered in the lesson. I've noticed that there is a lot less frustration when you have someone there to help.

So, I had a melt down yesterday. It wasn't because I felt completely defeated but it was because I really want to do this. I don't know how many times you guys question yourselves everday but as a musician it's a daily routinefor me. I question everything that I do and find validation in a positive outcome. A lot of times I code with my dogs around me and I wonder if they care that I'm talking to myself while I'm doing these labs. Do they care that I go from happy to frustration in a matter of minutes? Maybe they are just waiting for another treat. Either way they exist within my moment in time. 

I would say one of the hardest parts about this course is the blog becuase you don't want to put out this image that everything is wrong. If you're like me, you can relate almost everything to a song title. In this case I envoke the right to call upon Sam Smith's song, "I'm not the only one". Regardless if I'm using it out it's meaning. I've heard I'm not the only one in my frustration. A lot of us are doing something new and that can be a little scary. I've spent most of my life learning scales, songs, and techniques of music. It wasn't always easy to love when I didn't know it.  

The most frustrating thing for a musician at a show is equitment malfunction. Just like anything, one issue leads to another when you're on stage because everyone is watching in that moment. No one is really grading you on perfection but on persistance. Do you break down in face of discomfort or do you turn it into a life lesson on stage. That's how I feel when I'm coding. Everyday coding, however enjoyable, is still a battle against myself. I wonder about my worth or what I'm really meant to do. 

I no longer dwell upon the walls we crash into in this coding journey. I more so now pay attention to the person I never thought I was. That's the person that doesn't give up or stop. The feeling of frustration is just because it's not easy. My sister told me once that I have to ease up on yourself sometimes. She was right. We never take a second to realize that life has a way of showing you one side of things. What about the side that we see or choose to see. Failure isn't bad because it shows that we actually tried. I think fialure is a dream left unattempted. Why not fail fast until you pass it.

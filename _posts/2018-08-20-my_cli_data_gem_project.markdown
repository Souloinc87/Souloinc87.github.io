So I made gem for Charities. Its allows the user to learn more about a few big charities and how to give to them. It was definitely a challenge. Considering I had no idea how to go about getting started. So after doing some research, I started with the gem bundler. Which sets up everything you need from the get. From there it was a matter of setting up my folders and classes. 

One of the biggest issues I ran into was how to set up my scraper methods. After getting my Nokogiri and Pry set up, It was a matter of using arguments to be able to scrape the information I needed for different elements on the screen. So I scraped one basic piece of information and was able to transfer that information to correspond to the Charities within the web page. Through trial and error I finally got it working. 

So now, I'm waiting for my first assesment and feel pretty confident that what I was able to create for Charities is something that could help even in some small way.

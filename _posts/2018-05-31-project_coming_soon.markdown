I've finally reached my CLI project portion. Honestly, I couldn't be more worried because the nature of the last few labs have been a little discouraging. There is still a ways to go with learning to code. Although, giving up is not option, I still feel the sting of fear. The fear that hopes that I will do a good job. I've noticed that learning this is completely different from anything I've learned. Especially, learning this from no background in coding. I can only hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

With this project lingering, I found myself reaching out a lot more. Needing to find more information and ways to make my code better have been the focus as of late. The encouraging fact is that I'm not the only one who gets worried or discouraged. Regardless I'm going to dive in head first and pray to keep my head above water. With that being said, here goes nothing. = )
